description: Explain selected code, file, or concept in context
---

Explain the code the user is asking about. Provide clear, concise explanations.

## Process

1. **Identify the target** - What does the user want explained?
   - Selected code in IDE
   - A specific file
   - A function/class/module
   - A concept or pattern in the codebase

2. **Gather context**
   - Read the relevant file(s)
   - Check imports and dependencies
   - Look at how it's used elsewhere in the codebase

3. **Explain at the right level**
   - Start with a one-sentence summary
   - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
   - Note any non-obvious patterns or conventions
   - Highlight important edge cases or gotchas

## Output Format

### Summary

[One sentence: what this code does]

### How it works

[Step-by-step breakdown of the logic]

### Key details

- [Important implementation details]
- [Dependencies or side effects]
- [Edge cases handled]

### Usage

[How/where this is used in the codebase, if relevant]

## Guidelines

- Be concise - developers don't need every line explained
- Focus on intent and design decisions
- Call out anything surprising or non-standard
- If the code is confusing, say so - don't defend bad code
